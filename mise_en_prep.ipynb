    "### Description\n",
    "Mise en Prep is an application designed to help chefs and restraunts manage their food supply chains everyday. Restraunts need to ensure they get their ingredients on time so they are able to prepare them in time for service. This MVP uses local grocery stores locations and finds the average time it takes for deliveries to get from the store to the restraunt. "

    "# The Code!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Packages\n",
    "In this code call are all of the packages I used. The primary one I used was the openrouteservice which requires an API key to map things on a road. I took out my own API key but the code should work with your own API key. As a sidenote, in case this comes up, it is very quick and easy to get a token for the ors API, all you need is to make an account in the ORS dev dashboard, redeem a token, put it in the code, and everything should work. As for the dataset I used, it is a trimmed down dataset, to accomadate for ors, from data.gov. I have uploaded the data set with my MVP and will put the address of the restraunt I used so if you want you can test out the application MVP yourself. Thank you!\n",

    "## Research/Project Story\n",
    "I feel like I didn't really take a classic approach towards this project as my final ended up not having a lot of data or graphs. I am super interested in startups and entrepreneurship so I wanted to make an application that I thought would be an interesting startup idea that tied in the GIS information we learned in this course. Thus, I created this restaurant supply chain manager. My one map is the main aspect of the product and gives the chefs a visual look at where and how far away their suppliers are. The one table is simply extracted from the CSV and made to look nice so that it looks like somewhat of a coherent dashboard. It also serves a purpose as a part of the application as I believe it can help chefs reach out to and contact their suppliers when there are large delays and things of that nature. Finally, there is the most important part of the application which the little print out which states how much time it takes for each respective supplier to get to the restaurant. Using openrouteservice it maxed out my distance I could measure so I had to just use one supplier as an example, but I think it shows the viabily of my product here. Anyways I know this is a bit untraditional but I hope you enjoy and see the value in my project!"
